HELLO:

Hi, I’m **Tunde** 👋

I’m currently studying for the **Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP)** certification and building my skills in **Azure Security Engineering**.

This site is where I document my learning journey — from hands-on labs and technical notes to weekly reflections on what I’m learning and building along the way.

My goal is to move beyond theory and turn concepts into real, practical experience. To do that, I’ve created a learning roadmap that maps **CCSP domains** to **Azure Security Engineering labs**, allowing me to apply each idea in a real cloud environment as I progress.
